\chapter{Foreword}

	\textbf{Gollum} : What are potatoes my precious? What are they?\vspace{.2cm}\\

\chapter{Mandatory part}

	Following your first week of web training, in this last day you will have to set up a mini
	one-page site with your resumes. For those who don't know what a one-page site is, check
	out the list of sites present \href{https://bootstrapmade.com/bootstrap-resume-cv-templates/}{here}.

	\vspace{.2cm}Of course, we won't ask you to make this one as complete as these examples..\\

	\vspace{.2cm}Your first page will simply be a summary to go to the two CVs with two links.\\

	\vspace{.2cm}This first page must be \href{https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_responsive.asp}{responsive} and pretty! The use of css framework like bootstrap is strongly advised.\\

	A resume page must have at least all the following elements:

	\begin{itemize}

		\item \textbf{Navigation bar} : with links to the various sections of your page. Ensure that this navigation bar remains \textbf{fixed at the top} of the page for easy navigation.

		\item  \textbf{About section} that introduces you. You \textbf{must} include your name, a photo or image of yourself, and some interesting information about your background, education, or personal interests.

		\item  \textbf{Showcase section} to highlight your qualifications, which may include professional experiences, skills, or other relevant accomplishments. You can format this section with any content structures to highlight your achievements and qualifications effectively.

		\item  \textbf{Contact section} where you provide \textbf{links} to your social networks or professional profiles. Common options include links to platforms like Instagram, GitHub, LinkedIn, and any others that are relevant to your identity.

	\end{itemize}

	Feel free to customize and modify the sections, their content, and the overall design to match your personal preferences and the desired style of your resume page. You can also consider adding additional sections such as "Education," "Projects," or "Achievements" to further tailor your resume to your needs. We strongly advise you to use templates to help you.

	

\chapter{Submission and peer-evaluation}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item In the \textbf{discovery\_piscine} folder at the root of your home, create a new rush folder and navigate to it. 
		\item For this day your rendering file will be in the \textbf{rush} folder. This is where you will do all your work.
		\item You need to put an author file in the root of your rendering folder containing your
		logins, each on one line, and followed by a '\textbackslash n':
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{inverseverbatim}
		$> cat -e author
		krchuaip$
		tliangso$
		$>
	\end{inverseverbatim}

	\begin{caja}
		\vspace{.8cm}
		\fontfamily{lmr}\footnotesize Please note, during your defense anything that is not present in the folder for the day will not be checked.
